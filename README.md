### Explanation:
- **Table of Contents**: Each item in the ToC is linked to the respective section using GitHub's anchor link syntax. The link is created by converting the header text to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens (e.g., `## About the Project` becomes `#about-the-project`).
  
- **Headers**: The headers in the document (`##`, `###`, etc.) create the sections that the ToC links to. Ensure that these headers match the text in the ToC exactly, including casing and punctuation.

When you use this format, GitHub will automatically render the Table of Contents with clickable links, making it easy for users to navigate the README file.
