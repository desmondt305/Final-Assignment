      <p>
        This food app allows you to manage a list of food items, including
        adding, editing, and deleting foods. It's a simple CRUD (Create, Read,
        Update, Delete) application built with React and a mock API for
        demonstration purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is styled using React Bootstrap, making it easy to create
        responsive and modern-looking user interfaces.
      </p>
    </div>
